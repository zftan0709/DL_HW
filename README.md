# CPSC 881 Deep Learning HW1
__
## Introduction
In this assignment, there are three main tasks which are:
* HW1-1 Deep vs Shallow
* HW1-2 Optmization
* HW1-3 Generalization

## Instruction
Tensorflow 1.15, numpy, scikit-learn, and OpenCV are used for this assignment. Make sure that these libraries are installed before running the code. The tasks are separated into individual files as listed as below.
* HW1-1 Simulated Function
* HW1-1 CNN on MNIST
* HW1-2 Optimization
* HW1-3 Random Label
* HW1-3 Parameters vs Generalization
* HW1-3 Flatness vs Generalization
* HW1-3 Flatness vs Generalization Part 2
To visualize the result, run these code to acquire corresponding figures and results. To provide better visualization, both .py and .ipynb files are included in this repository.
