# CPSC 881 Deep Learning HW2

## Introduction
In this assignment, a sequence-to-sequence model, S2VT is trained to generate caption for given input features
## Instruction
Tensorflow 1.15, keras, and numpy are used for this assignment. Make sure that these libraries are installed before running the code. 

* hw2_seq2seq.py – contains model, training, and testing function
* dataset.py – contains dataset class to preprocess input features
* output_testset.txt – output captions generated by the model
* bleu_eval.py – calculate bleu score based on output_testset.txt

To achieve the bleu score, run the provided sh file with feature directory and model output text file. For instance, 
```
sh hw2_seq2seq.sh ./testing_data/feat/ output_testset.txt
```
